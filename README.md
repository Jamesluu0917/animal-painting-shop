# Animal Painting Shop

An e-commerce website that displays products on sale, which can be searched and sorted. It includes a cart page that shows products and a checkout option. The website's front-end was built using Angular to provide a dynamic and responsive user experience. For the backend, a mock API was created using Mockoon, allowing the front-end application to send requests and receive responses as if interacting with a real server. This setup allows for a fully functional front-end demonstration, highlighting the core features of an e-commerce platform.
